# Python Calculator
Python calculators with increasingly complicated GUI designs and functionality. Built as a beginning project
with my close friend from UCD so that I can introduce him to the world of coding. GUI developed with 
PyQt5 and QtDesigner. Operations are appended onto a string and when the equals `=` button is pressed, 
we have it set to evaluate the global string.

# Current and Future Versions
### Currently
We have a calculator that does simple mathematic operations and tries to mimic the iPhone calculator.
Has an extra button for 'pi' as `pi`, modulo as `%`, and square in the form of `a**2`.
The code for our original version was terrible, so I fixed some of the logic and introduced a few more cases.

### Future
We want to create a more robust calulator with more buttons and increased functionality. This includes, but 
is not limited to, grouping symbols, and typing input solely through the keyboard.

# What We Have Learned
Learned about PyQt5 and how to use QtDesigner to create GUI applications. Also learned that naive code is 
terrible code. And make sure that your code is readable. Please.
